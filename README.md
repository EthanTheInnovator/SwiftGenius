## A pure Swift implementation of the Genius (aka RapGenius) JSON API

iOS developers can use this pure Swift (and Swift-*like*) library to access the wealth of song trivia and commentary on [Genius.com](https://genius.com). It takes full advantage of the `Codable` protocol that was introduced in Swift 4.
